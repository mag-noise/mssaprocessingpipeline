%  MSSAMex - Signal Processing for 2 signals
% 
%  The calling syntax is:
% 	
% 	[inboard_result, outboard_result, flags, win, wout] = MSSAMex(inboard, outboard, timeline) Uses MSSA on signals with default values (alpha = 0.05, segment_size = 5000, window_size = 40)
%
%	[inboard_result, outboard_result, flags, win, wout] = MSSAMex(inboard, outboard, timeline, alpha) Uses MSSA on signals with user defined alpha.
% 
% 	[inboard_result, outboard_result, flags, win, wout] = MSSAMex(inboard, outboard, timeline, alpha, segment_size, window_size) Uses MSSA on signals with user defined alpha and sizes
% 
%	Function inputs are as ordered in the following manner:
%		1. inboard_input: 3D magnetic field data in 3xN double value format
%		2. outboard_input: 3D magnetic field data in 3xN double value format
%		3. timeline: 1D matrix of datetime values representing the time the magnetic field data record was recorded
%		4. alpha_threshold: Value between [0, 1] used to select components for reconstruction
%		5. segment_size: Size of the N magnetic field data points to use as for each analysis cycle. If the segment_size < N, the magnetic field data is broken up into N/segment_size-1 segments (exludes last segment)
%		6. window_size: Size of the window used by MSSA when deconstructing signal.
%
%	Function outputs are ordered as follows:
%		1. inboard_result: Reconstructed 3D magnetic field data representing the Inboard data
%		2. outboard_result: Reconstructed 3D magnetic field data representing the Outboard data
%		3. flags: Flags representing how each element has been affected or considered. The current makeup is an 8-bit integer with each bit representing a flag. Flags from right to left are as follows:
%			a. NaN: value has been registered as a NaN
%			b. Time Jump: value represents the start of a new segment due to a discontinuity in the timeline
%			c. Skipped: value will be equal to the original input signal
%			d. Merged: value has been marked as being merged between 2 segments separately running MSSA
%		4. win: Wheel of inboard signal
%		5. wout: Wheel of outboard signal
